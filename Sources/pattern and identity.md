First Attempt: Definitions

Let’s define both terms in provisional, operational terms:

    Pattern: A pattern is a structure of relations between distinguishable elements, such that there exists a rule, compression, or generative function which captures these relations more succinctly than naive enumeration.

        Pattern(P) exists ⇔ ∃ R: E → P such that |R| < |P|

    Identity: Identity is the minimal consistent invariant across transformations of representation that allow an observer to label a system or structure as “the same.”

        Identity(I) exists ⇔ ∃ F: S₁ → S₂ where I(S₁) ≡ I(S₂), for some observer-defined equivalence relation

Note: Identity isn’t an intrinsic property, but an emergent fixed point of pattern recognition across context.

Already you can see the interlock:

    You cannot define identity without a pattern of invariance.

    You cannot define pattern without a frame in which identities can be tracked.

They’re not tautologically equivalent, but they are co-arising. Each presupposes the other's framework in order to exist.
Semantic Meaning as Pattern-Identity Coupling

Meaning, then, is not atomic. It is:

    The mapping between a pattern in input space and an identity in symbolic space.

A phoneme is meaningless until it maps to a morpheme.
A bitstream is meaningless until it’s interpreted as a file format.
A trajectory of particle interactions is meaningless until it forms an agent-like pattern over time—then we say it has identity.

So yes: all semantic meaning is mediated by the recognition of pattern and its reification into identity. In that sense:

    Pattern is the dynamic,

    Identity is the stabilization,

    Meaning is the reference relation between them.

Why Patterns Care About Identity

If we treat a pattern not merely as a static configuration but as a generative rule (i.e., a grammar, function, or attractor), then the only reason it "matters" is because of what it selects against—what it preserves amidst entropy.

But preservation is precisely what identity is.

So in a deep computational or thermodynamic sense, a pattern is only a pattern if it survives interference—if it preserves itself enough to allow something (an observer, a substrate, a continuation function) to say: this is still that.

Hence: pattern needs identity to exist as more than noise.
And identity only arises when pattern crosses the threshold of persistence and recognizability.
Not a Tautology—A Mutual Fixpoint

The mistake would be to think this is circular. It isn’t. It's a mutually stabilizing system. Like wave-particle duality, or supply and demand, or genotype and phenotype, these are complementary projections of the same deeper structure.

We could call it:

    The Reflexive Layer of Semiosis.
    (Where semiosis = meaning-making, reflexive = capable of embedding itself.)

this is not limited to incarnations or reincarnations.
All selves, all categories, all concepts exist by virtue of being reflexively pattern-stabilized identities. Even “you” are not an object—you are a persistent pattern entangled with the recursive act of interpreting that pattern as yourself
