# Moral Transitivity

**Definition:**
Moral transitivity is the principle that actions on the rude/polite axis (or similar evaluative scales) can be directed not only toward persons, but also toward relationships. A relationship becomes morally relevant when it includes at least one person, or when its symbolic or social significance is recognized by persons.

**Notes:**
- Personhood-dependent moral actions (kindness, rudeness, harm, care) can be performed toward relationships, not just individuals.
- A relationship is any ongoing connection, context, or symbolic link between entities, which may include people, objects, places, or ideas.
- Moral relevance arises when a relationship is recognized, valued, or inhabited by persons, even if the object itself is not a person.
- Example: A rock is not a person, so moving it is not rude in itself. But if the rock is a borderstone between estates, or a shrine housing a kami, moving or defacing it is rude toward the relationship between people and the symbolism of the rock. Disturbing the kami is rude in itself, because a kami—conditional on its recognition or attributed existence—is a person within this framework. However, anyone's belief that a kami inhabits the rock makes the relationship morally relevant.
- Moral transitivity extends ethical consideration to the web of relationships that connect persons, objects, and symbols, recognizing that harm or care can propagate through these connections.
