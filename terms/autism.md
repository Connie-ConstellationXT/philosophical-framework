# autism

**Definition:**  
Autism can be modeled as a cognitive architecture characterized by (1) reduced tolerance for control-switch fatigue and (2) a globalized style of predictive integration, where new information is embedded into the full representational manifold rather than bounded heuristics. The result is heightened precision, boundary-demand, and overload sensitivity.


**Characteristics:**

---


- **Control Fatigue Sensitivity:** Frequent updates to working memory and task rules overtax the fronto-striatal gating system. Autistic cognition saturates earlier under rapid context switches, leading to shutdowns or blunt responses.
- **Global Integration:** Incoming statements are evaluated against the entire embedding space, with real-time boundary inference rather than naïve local scoping. This yields high fidelity but high metabolic cost.
- **Explicit Boundary Demand:** Truth claims are not safely internalized unless their domains are specified. Vague or implicit rules create anxiety, because the brain attempts full boundary reconstruction.
- **Rigidity as Efficiency:** Preference for routines and predictability reduces unnecessary gate-switching and protects against fatigue. What looks like rigidity is an optimization against metabolic overload.

**Neurobiology:**
- **Fronto-striatal circuits:** dlPFC, basal ganglia, and subthalamic nucleus show atypical gating dynamics. Each task switch requires higher cost, recruiting the hyperdirect pathway more often.
- **LC–NE modulation:** Locus coeruleus norepinephrine balance drifts into tonic mode under switch pressure, broadening attention but reducing focus precision.
- **ACC conflict monitoring:** Anterior cingulate cortex signals frequent unresolved conflict, inflating the subjective cost of decisions.
- **Sensory Cortices:** Heightened bottom-up gain leads to stronger and more precise prediction errors, amplifying the need for global reconciliation.

---

**Contrast:**
- Neurotypical processing favors bounded heuristics and local truth application. This is cheaper but less exact.
- Autistic processing re-embeds each input globally, making it more exact but more fragile under load.

---

**Implications:**
- **Sensory sensitivity:** Over-precise error coding in sensory cortices; every deviation demands reconciliation.
- **Special interests/repetitions:** Stable domains reduce switch load and allow precise integration without constant fatigue.
- **Social friction:** Neurotypicals rely on implicit scoping; autistic cognition requires explicit boundaries, making small talk inefficient.

**Signed-scalar framing (cf. truth.md):**  
A statement’s truth value for an autistic learner depends strongly on explicit boundary marking. Without boundaries, the same statement can be negative-truth (inducing overload through mis-scoping) where it would be mildly positive-truth for a neurotypical learner.

---

**Summary:**  
Autism emerges when predictive integration prioritizes global fidelity over local efficiency, coupled with reduced tolerance for high-frequency control reconfiguration. The outcome is heightened sensitivity, demand for explicitness, and vulnerability to overload—but also deep precision and system-level insight when environments respect boundary clarity and minimize unnecessary context churn.
