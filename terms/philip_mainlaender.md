# Philipp Mainländer

**Definition:**
Philipp Mainländer (1841–1876) was a German philosopher and poet known for his radical pessimism and nihilistic worldview. He argued that the ultimate reality is the will to die, and that the highest good is the cessation of existence. Mainländer's philosophy is often cited as an extreme example of nihilism, culminating in his own suicide shortly after completing his major work, "The Philosophy of Redemption."

**Notes:**
- Mainländer's worldview is a cautionary tale about the dangers of unmitigated nihilism.
- His life and work illustrate the existential risks of embracing meaninglessness without constructing compensatory frameworks.
- In this system, hallucinating meaning—even in the face of nihilism—is not only permissible but a moral obligation, as it preserves continuity and prevents existential collapse.
