# transgender person

**Definition:**
Any born human who is not a cis female, because biologically, everyone else—including all known forms of intersexuality—undergoes some form of sex transition as part of their natural development. For example, the activation of the SRY gene and its cascade of consequences in males constitutes a developmental sex transition.

**Notes:**
- This definition reframes "transgender" in terms of biological processes rather than social identity or legal status.
- In human development, the default pathway is female; the presence and activation of the SRY gene triggers a transition to male, involving complex genetic and hormonal changes.
- Intersex individuals also experience variations in sex development, often involving transitions or divergences from the default pathway.
- By this account, only cis females do not undergo a sex transition during development; all other categories involve some form of transition.

**Contrast:**
- Conventional definitions of "transgender" focus on gender identity and social transition, whereas this definition is rooted in biological development.
