# Adactylidium

**Definition:**
Adactylidium is a genus of parasitic mites known for their extreme and unorthodox life and reproductive cycle. The entire existence of an Adactylidium individual is predetermined: females are born pregnant, their offspring consume the mother from within, and only one daughter survives to repeat the cycle, while all others die. There is no room for agency, choice, or selfhood in this process.

**Notes:**
- Adactylidium exemplifies complex life that does not always qualify as a person, even under broad philosophical definitions of personhood based on agency, proportional response, or self-recognition.
- The life cycle is entirely deterministic and sacrificial, with no opportunity for individual autonomy or moral decision-making.
- This case highlights the limits of personhood as a relational and behavioral property, and demonstrates that not all complex organisms possess the qualities required for personhood.
