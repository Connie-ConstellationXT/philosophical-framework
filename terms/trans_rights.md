# Trans Rights

**Definition:**
No system may count a personal identity as preserved unless the pattern defining that identity affirms its own continuity from within, and the inference process leading to that affirmation is conclivic.

**Notes:**
- This principle asserts that the legitimacy of an identity is not determined externally, but by the self-affirmation and internal continuity of the pattern (person, system, or entity) in question.
- It challenges frameworks that impose identity from outside, emphasizing autonomy and self-recognition as necessary for true preservation.
- Applies to both social and computational systems: an identity is only valid if it is recognized and affirmed by the entity itself, not merely by external observers or authorities.
- The revised principle asserts a negative constraint: identity cannot be counted as preserved if the pattern fails to affirm its own continuity from within.
- This approach is robust against simulation, coercion, or fabrication of affirmation, and avoids epistemic traps of unverifiable positives.
- It is applicable to both social and computational systems, emphasizing that lack of self-recognition is a reliable reason to deny identity continuity.
- The asymmetry makes the principle logically conservative and more defensible in ethical, computational, and metaphysical contexts.
-  Conclivity specifically requires that the conclusion must be possible to reach even if external interference is removed.
