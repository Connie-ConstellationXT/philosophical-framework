# Pattern

**Definition:**
A pattern is a structure of relations between distinguishable elements, such that there exists a rule, compression, or generative function which captures these relations more succinctly than naive enumeration. Patterns are not merely static configurations, but can be seen as generative rules or attractors—dynamic processes that persist through time and transformation.

**Prose:**
Patterns are the dynamic aspect of meaning-making. They are recognized by their invariance across change, their ability to survive interference, and their capacity to be compressed into simpler representations. In both computation and cognition, a pattern is only meaningful if it can be tracked, predicted, or compressed—if it is more than mere noise. Patterns require a frame of reference in which identities can be tracked, and their existence is always relative to an observer or system capable of recognizing them.

Pattern and identity are not separate, nor are they separable. Each presupposes the other's framework in order to exist: you cannot define identity without a pattern of invariance, and you cannot define pattern without a frame in which identities can be tracked. They are mutually arising, forming a reflexive layer of meaning-making where the dynamic (pattern) and the stabilization (identity) are inextricably linked.
