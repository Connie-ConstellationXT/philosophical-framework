# Virus (biological)

**Definition:**
A biological virus is a microscopic infectious agent that can only replicate inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses consist of genetic material (DNA or RNA) encased in a protein coat, and sometimes a lipid envelope. They infect all forms of life, including animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria (where they are called bacteriophages). Viruses lack cellular structure and independent metabolism, relying entirely on host cells for reproduction and propagation.

**Discussion:**
Traditionally, viruses are not considered persons or even living organisms in the strictest sense, as they do not exhibit independent metabolism or self-sustaining biological processes. However, some viruses display behaviors that challenge this boundary. Unlike the adactylidium mite, which follows a rigid, pre-determined life cycle, certain viruses can adaptively respond to their environmentâ€”specifically, to the immune defenses of their hosts.

Interestingly, the immune system's response to viral infection can be mapped onto a rudeness/politeness spectrum, depending on the context and the perceived threat. However, in the case of viral infection, the host body's imperative for self-preservation typically overrides any demand for respect or recognition that might be associated with personhood. The immune system's primary goal is to eliminate the threat, regardless of the virus's adaptive or agent-like behaviors.

For example, HIV and some coronaviruses (notably SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19) can detect and respond to immune system activity by altering their replication strategies, mutating to evade immune detection, or changing the proteins they express. This capacity for adaptive, context-sensitive response blurs the line between mere mechanism and agency. In this sense, such viruses can be argued to possess a form of personhood, as they exhibit goal-directed, context-responsive behavior that is not strictly pre-programmed but contingent on environmental feedback.

**Contrast with Adactylidium:**
The adactylidium mite is an example of a biological entity with a fixed, deterministic life cycle, showing no evidence of adaptive response to its environment. In contrast, some viruses demonstrate a form of strategic adaptation, responding to host defenses in ways that can be interpreted as tactical or even intentional at a minimal level.

**Examples:**
- **HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus):** Mutates rapidly to escape immune detection, changes cell tropism, and can enter latent states to avoid immune clearance.
- **SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19):** Exhibits mutations in spike proteins to evade antibodies, and can alter replication rates in response to host immune pressure.
