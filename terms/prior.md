# Prior

**Definition:**
A prior is any pre-existing belief, assumption, experience, or model that shapes how an entity interprets new information. Priors are the background knowledge or expectations that influence encoding, decoding, and understanding in communication and cognition.

**Notes:**
- Priors determine how messages are constructed and received in human natural language (HNL).
- Differences in priors between speaker and listener are a major source of miscommunication and loss.
- Priors can be explicit (conscious beliefs) or implicit (unconscious biases, habits, or cultural norms).
- Updating priors is central to learning and adaptation.
