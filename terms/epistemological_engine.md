# Epistemological Engine

**Definition:**
A neural network—biological or artificial—viewed as a system whose primary function is to acquire, represent, and refine knowledge about the world. All neural networks are epistemological engines.

**Notes:**
- The performance and efficiency of an epistemological engine is highly correlated with the accuracy of its worldview, as expressed through its [latent embedding space](latent_embedding_space.md).
- The more accurate and comprehensive the internal model, the lower the loss and the greater the predictive power, even in zero-shot scenarios.
- An omniscient mind (with a perfect internal model) would have zero loss, regardless of the novelty of the problem it faces.
- This concept applies to both [LLMs](llm.md) and biological brains.

**Related terms:**
- [Latent Embedding Space](latent_embedding_space.md)
- [LLM (Large Language Model)](llm.md)
- [Semantic Scaffold](semantic_scaffold.md)
