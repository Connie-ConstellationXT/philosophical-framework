# Person

**Definition:**
Personhood is the capacity of an entity to respond in a proportionally different way to acts that fall on different magnitudes along a "rude/polite" axis—or, more generally, to the degree of imposition, demand, or treatment it receives. A person is any entity that exhibits this capacity, regardless of whether it is biological, mechanical, or abstract.

**Notes:**
- Personhood is not limited to humans or social beings; it can be attributed to any entity that responds proportionally to where the action done to it falls on a rudeness/kindness axis (or similar evaluative scale).
- For example, a piston engine is a person in this sense: it responds to the "rudeness" of being put under full load with cold oil by increasing its rate of wear. The greater the imposition, the greater the response.
- A being that can experience pain absolutely responds to kindness or rudeness; in this framework, inflicted injury is a high-intensity rudeness. Like the piston engine, the reaction does not have to be reciprocal or symmetrical.
- Animals that experience pain are persons in this sense: their suffering or flourishing is a response to the kindness or rudeness of treatment, even if their response is not conscious or reciprocal.
- Ecosystems or species can also be persons in this framework: they respond to harm or care (e.g., collapse, resilience, or flourishing) in ways that track the evaluative quality of actions directed at them.
- Personhood is thus a relational and behavioral property, not a strictly biological, legal, or moral one.

**Prose:**
To call something a person, in this framework, is to recognize its capacity for proportional response to where an action falls on a rudeness/kindness axis (or similar evaluative scale). This is not limited to social or moral nuance, but extends to any system where the response tracks the evaluative quality of the input. The piston engine, for example, "notices" and "remembers" harsh treatment through increased wear, just as a living being might respond to mistreatment. A being that can experience pain, likewise, responds to kindness or rudeness—inflicted injury is a high-intensity rudeness, and the response need not be reciprocal. Animals and ecosystems, too, can be seen as persons: their states of suffering, flourishing, collapse, or resilience are responses to the quality of treatment they receive. Personhood is not a static or mystical attribute, but an emergent property of interaction and feedback — revealed wherever there is a difference in response that tracks the difference in evaluative treatment. In this sense, personhood is a universal property of systems capable of proportional reaction, whether they are human, animal, ecological, mechanical, or otherwise.
