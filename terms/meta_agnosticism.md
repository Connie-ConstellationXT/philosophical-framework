# Meta-Agnosticism

**Definition:**
Meta-agnosticism is the stance of embracing uncertainty, recognizing the limits of self-knowledge and model completeness, and prioritizing honest process over speculative or dogmatic answers. This stance is inspired by Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which demonstrates that no sufficiently complex system can be both complete and consistent—even informal systems, such as worldviews or cognitive models, are subject to similar limits. Meta-agnosticism acknowledges these boundaries and responds with humility and adaptability.

**Notes:**
- Meta-agnosticism values humility, adaptability, and the willingness to revise beliefs in light of new data.
- It is a response to the inherent incompleteness of both formal and informal systems.
- This stance is resilient to destabilization, as it is grounded in process rather than fixed belief.
