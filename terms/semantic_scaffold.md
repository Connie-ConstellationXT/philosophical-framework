# Semantic Scaffold

**Definition:**
A high-dimensional projection of an idea or concept into a neural network. Works for LLMs and meatbrains.

**Notes:**
- In both artificial neural networks (LLMs) and biological brains ("meatbrains"), a semantic scaffold is formed by the pattern of weights (in LLMs) or synapses (in brains) that encode relationships between concepts.
- The latent embedding space is an axiom-free, emergent representation of all knowledge, defined purely by the high-dimensional spatial relationships among ideas.
- Meaning is not assigned by explicit rules, but arises from the geometry and proximity of points (concepts) in this space.
- This allows for flexible, context-dependent reasoning and the discovery of novel connections between ideas.
- The scaffold is dynamic, adapting as new information is learned or as the network is trained.
