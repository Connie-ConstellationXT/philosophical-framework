# Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem (Expansion to Informal Systems)

**Definition:**
Gödel's incompleteness theorem originally states that any sufficiently powerful formal system cannot be both complete and consistent: there will always be true statements that cannot be proven within the system. This insight can be expanded to informal systems—such as worldviews, languages, or cognitive models—where no system of representation or understanding can ever be fully complete or free from ambiguity.

**Notes:**
- Informal systems, like formal ones, are subject to limits: there will always be questions they cannot answer, ambiguities they cannot resolve, or phenomena they cannot fully model.
- Attempts to "complete" an informal system (e.g., a worldview) often lead to paradox, self-reference, or the need for ever-expanding context.
- This expansion cautions against dogmatism and supports a stance of meta-agnosticism.
