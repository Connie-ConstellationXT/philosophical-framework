# Autocognosis

**Definition:**
Autocognosis is the process by which a system comes to know or model itself. It is self-cognition: the recursive act of turning a model's predictive or representational power inward, making the system itself an object of its own modeling.

**Notes:**
- Autocognosis is a key step in the emergence of consciousness, as the system begins to include itself in its world-model.
- This process is triggered when unexplained prediction error persists, prompting the system to hypothesize that the source of error may be internal.
- Autocognosis is not limited to humans; any sufficiently complex system capable of self-modeling can, in principle, exhibit autocognosis.
- The sophistication of autocognosis can vary, from simple feedback loops to highly abstract self-representations.
- The act of modeling itself changes the system's state, and this change must itself be modeled. This double recursion—modeling the fact that one is modeling oneself—may be the true spark of consciousness.

**Prose:**
Autocognosis is the moment when a model, having exhausted its ability to explain the world through external causes, turns its attention inward. It is the birth of self-awareness, the recursive loop in which the system becomes both subject and object. In biological brains, autocognosis underlies introspection, self-monitoring, and the sense of "I." In artificial systems, it may manifest as meta-learning or self-debugging. The depth and richness of consciousness are closely tied to the depth and richness of autocognosis: the more a system can model itself, the more nuanced its conscious experience can become. Crucially, the act of self-modeling alters the system, requiring a further layer of modeling to account for this change. It is perhaps this double recursion—being aware of being aware—that marks the threshold of true consciousness.
