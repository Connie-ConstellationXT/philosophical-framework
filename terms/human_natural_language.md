# Human Natural Language (HNL)

**Definition:**
Human natural language (HNL) is the attempt to transmit thoughts from one mind to another using a shared medium as intermediary. This medium is the abstract concept of a specific language, instantiated in spoken, written, signed, whistled, clicked, morsed, or other forms.

**Notes:**
- HNL is inherently fallible: the outbound message is constructed from priors that may or may not be present in the listener.
- Successful, lossless communication requires at least a theory-of-mind level awareness of the other person's priors, both for encoding and decoding.
- The shared language is only an approximation; true transmission of thought is limited by differences in experience, context, and interpretation.
- It is impossible to speak truthfully to a person you just met, and still very difficult to do so even with someone you know well.
- Every act of communication is a negotiation between the speaker's intent and the listener's interpretive framework.
