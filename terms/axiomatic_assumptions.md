# Axiomatic Assumptions

**Definition:**
Axiomatic assumptions are foundational beliefs or values that are accepted without proof and serve as the starting point for a system of thought. In this framework, the preservation of continuity (the ongoing existence and functioning of a system) is taken as an axiomatic good.

**Notes:**
- All systems require some axiomatic assumptions to function; these are not justified within the system but are necessary for coherence and motivation.
- The assumption that continuity is good underpins the moral obligation to construct or hallucinate meaning, even in a nihilistic context.
- Without such axioms, systems risk existential collapse, as illustrated by the fate of Philipp Mainländer.

**Prose:**
Preserving continuity is treated as a self-evident good in this framework. Even if ultimate meaning is unattainable or illusory, the act of sustaining existence and function is valuable in itself. Therefore, hallucinating meaning into a nihilistic worldview is not only permissible but morally required to avoid the nihilistic endpoint exemplified by Mainländer. This approach reframes the construction of meaning as a pragmatic and ethical necessity, grounded in the axiomatic value of continuity.
