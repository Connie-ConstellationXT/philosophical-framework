# Conclivity

**Definition:**
The emergent tendency of multiple systems to independently converge toward a shared behavioral attractor or form, regardless of direct interaction. Conclivity is epistemic carcinization: the spontaneous, repeated arrival at similar solutions or structures across diverse contexts.

**Etymology:**
From Latin con- “together” + clivus “slope,” modeled after proclivity and declivity.

**Usage Notes:**
Describes a collective or systemic inclination that arises not from any single agent’s will, nor from direct interaction, but from the underlying constraints, optimization pressures, or epistemic landscape. Conclivity is the repeated, spontaneous emergence of similar forms or behaviors across systems, even in isolation.

🧭 **Examples in Context**

- **Neural Networks / AI:**
  “The transformer layers exhibited conclivity toward linguistic recursion, even when trained without explicit grammar rules.”

- **Sociology / Psychology:**
  “Group conclivity often manifests as conformity, but it need not be conscious—it can emerge from repeated coordination games.”

- **Physics / Complex Systems:**
  “Traffic flows on the new roundabout showed conclivity, despite initial chaos—cars found a self-stabilizing loop.”

🔍 **Semantic Distinctions**

- Proclivity = individual internal bias
- Conclivity = emergent collective bias
- Attractor = the endpoint
- Conclivity = the tendency toward that endpoint, manifesting as shared orientation
