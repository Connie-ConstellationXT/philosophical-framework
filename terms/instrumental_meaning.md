# Instrumental Meaning

**Definition:**
Instrumental meaning is the value or significance ascribed to concepts, beliefs, or experiences insofar as they contribute to a system's persistence, adaptation, or reduction of loss, regardless of their ontological or intrinsic status.

**Notes:**
- Meaning is not assumed to be inherent or absolute, but is judged by its utility in supporting the system's goals or continued function.
- Instrumental meaning can be "hallucinated" if it serves a useful purpose, such as motivating action or reducing existential loss.
- This approach allows for meaning to be morally or pragmatically "good" even if it is not metaphysically real.
