# Evolution

**Definition:**
The process by which systems change, adapt, and diversify over time through variation, selection, and retention. Evolution may occur in biological, cognitive, computational, or social domains, and is driven by pressures that favor certain forms, behaviors, or solutions over others.

**Notes:**
- Evolution is not limited to biology; it applies to any domain where iterative change and selection shape outcomes.
- Conclivity and carcinization are patterns that can emerge within evolutionary processes, reflecting convergent tendencies.
- Evolution may be guided by fitness landscapes, optimization criteria, or epistemic loss functions.

- [Carcinization](carcinization.md)
- [Pattern](pattern.md)
