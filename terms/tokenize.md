# Tokenize (Neural Context)

**Definition:**
The process of converting an idea, word, or concept into a discrete representation (token) that can be processed by a neural network.

**Notes:**
- In LLMs, tokenization breaks text into units for embedding and computation.
- In brains, analogous processes may occur as concepts are encoded into neural patterns.
