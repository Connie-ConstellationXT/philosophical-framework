# Model Fidelity

**Definition:**
Model fidelity is the degree to which a worldview, theory, or internal model accurately compresses and predicts the structure of reality, as measured by its ability to minimize loss or error. High model fidelity means a system's representations closely match the patterns present in the world, enabling efficient prediction and adaptation.

**Notes:**
- Model fidelity is not about absolute truth, but about the pragmatic success of a model in reducing loss and improving predictive power.
- Competing models can be compared by their fidelity, even if they are incommensurable in other respects.
- Fidelity is always relative to the available data and the system's capacity for representation.
