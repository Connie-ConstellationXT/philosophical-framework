# ATP

**Definition:**
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the primary energy carrier in biological cells, used to power cellular processes, including neural activity in brains.

**Notes:**
- In the context of brains, ATP is consumed when neurons fire and process information.
- Energy efficiency in neural computation is often measured in terms of ATP usage.

**Theoretical Perspective:**
Some theories propose that fuel (ATP) consumption is the primary feedback signal the brain uses to assess its own fitness and efficiency. In this framework, the brain's unusually high energy usage—relative to other organs—is not a flaw but a feature: it amplifies the signal by which differences in efficiency between competing semantic scaffolds or mental models are detected. When the baseline energy cost is high, even small improvements in efficiency (i.e., small reductions in ATP usage) produce a proportionally larger and more detectable change in total consumption. This heightened sensitivity allows the brain to distinguish subtle differences in scaffold efficiency that might be lost in the noise if the overall energy budget were lower. In contrast, a fundamentally more efficient brain would have a weaker signal—small improvements would be harder to detect against a low baseline, making fine-grained optimization less responsive. Thus, high energy use acts as a magnifier for the feedback loop that drives the evolution and refinement of cognitive structures, favoring those that minimize ATP consumption while preserving or enhancing predictive power.

This perspective also helps explain why infant brains are especially malleable. In early development, the brain's relative ATP consumption is even higher and its semantic scaffolds are less efficient, so small improvements in efficiency yield large, easily detected changes in energy use. This amplifies the feedback signal, making the brain highly sensitive to optimization—analogous to a larger "training step size" in machine learning, where each update produces a more significant adjustment. As the brain matures and its scaffolds become more efficient, the baseline energy cost drops, the signal weakens, and the effective step size for learning decreases, naturally reducing plasticity over time.
