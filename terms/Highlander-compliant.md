# Highlander-compliant

**Definition:**
A system, object, or concept is described as "Highlander-compliant" when it is a singletonâ€”meaning only one instance exists or is permitted to exist within a given context. The term references the popular phrase "There can be only one" from the Highlander franchise, emphasizing uniqueness and exclusivity.

**Characteristics:**
- Singleton: Only one instance is allowed or possible.
- Uniqueness: Guarantees that no duplicates or alternatives exist in the defined scope.
- Enforced exclusivity: Mechanisms or rules prevent the creation of additional instances.

**Contrast:**
- Non-Highlander-compliant systems allow multiple instances, copies, or alternatives.
