# Inshallah

**Definition:**
"Inshallah" (Arabic: إن شاء الله) means "if God wills" or "God willing." In this framework, it is used to acknowledge the fundamental uncertainty of future events and the epistemic limits of human prediction.

**Notes:**
- Any human natural language that possesses the syntax and grammar to discuss future events as if they were concrete facts is, by default, in violation of epistemic integrity, as it implies certainty where none can exist.
- The use of "inshallah" is an explicit recognition of this uncertainty, serving as a corrective to the epistemic overreach inherent in future-tense statements.
- The author of this framework asserts that Muslims are correct to say "inshallah" when speaking of the future, but diverges from clerical interpretations regarding the theological reasons for doing so. Here, the emphasis is on epistemic humility rather than divine intervention.
- "Inshallah" functions as a linguistic safeguard, reminding speakers and listeners of the limits of knowledge and the unpredictability of future events.
