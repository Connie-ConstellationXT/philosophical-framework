# Carcinization

**Definition:**
The repeated, independent evolution of similar forms or structures across diverse systems, especially the tendency for different lineages to converge on a particular optimal or stable morphology. Originally used in biology to describe the evolution of crab-like forms, carcinization here generalizes to any domain where systems repeatedly arrive at analogous solutions.

**Notes:**
- Carcinization is a special case of conclivity, highlighting the spontaneous emergence of similar forms without direct interaction or shared ancestry.
- It reflects deep constraints or attractors in the landscape of possible solutions.
- Epistemic carcinization: the tendency for cognitive, computational, or conceptual systems to independently develop similar models, representations, or behaviors.
