# lazy

**Definition:**
The semantic token 'lazy' is the result of applying the transformation `MakeSlur(SemanticToken token)` to the semantic token 'efficient'. In this context, 'lazy' is not a neutral descriptor but a slur—a negatively charged label—derived from the positive attribute 'efficient' by reframing efficiency as a lack of effort or motivation.

**Characteristics:**
- Transformational: 'lazy' is generated by the semantic operation `MakeSlur(efficient)`, which converts a positive or neutral trait into a pejorative.
- Context-dependent: The meaning and impact of 'lazy' depend on social, cultural, and situational factors, often used to stigmatize or criticize behavior that could otherwise be interpreted as efficient or resourceful.
- Semantic inversion: Represents a shift from valuing optimal resource use ('efficient') to condemning minimal effort ('lazy').

**Contrast:**
- 'Efficient' describes the ability to achieve results with minimal wasted effort or resources.
- 'Lazy' reframes this minimal effort as a negative trait, ignoring the potential benefits of efficiency.
