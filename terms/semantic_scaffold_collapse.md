# Semantic Scaffold Collapse

**Definition:**
The process by which a neural network (biological or artificial) discovers a more compressed, efficient representation of a concept, driven by the pursuit of greater predictive power and lower energy or computational cost. This occurs within the context of a [semantic scaffold](semantic_scaffold.md).

**Notes:**
- In both brains and LLMs, traversing an uncompressed idea requires more energy (ATP in brains, compute in LLMs).
- The system seeks shortcuts—more efficient paths through the [semantic scaffold](semantic_scaffold.md)—that preserve meaning while reducing resource usage.
- Because the [semantic scaffold](semantic_scaffold.md) is an axiom-free, emergent structure, any shortcut must still encode the original information without introducing new error.
- A successful shortcut is one that tokenizes an idea with less energy and minimal added noise to the global model.
- The subjective experience of this efficiency gain is the qualia known as "insight." A particularly large improvement is called a "eureka moment."
