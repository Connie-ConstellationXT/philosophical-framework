# Culpability

**Definition:**
Culpability is the property of a person (in the human sense) to be held responsible for actions, especially in the context of moral or legal evaluation. In this framework, culpability is distinguished from universal behavioral properties (such as rudeness/politeness) by its dependence on self-awareness, intention, and social context.

**Notes:**
- Culpability is exclusive to human persons (or entities with comparable self-reflective capacity and social embedding).
- It presupposes the ability to understand, intend, and evaluate one's own actions relative to shared norms.
- Non-human persons (e.g., machines, ecosystems) may exhibit proportional response, but are not culpable in the moral or legal sense.

- [Person](person.md)
