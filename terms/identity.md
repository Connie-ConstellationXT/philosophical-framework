# Identity

**Definition:**
Identity is the minimal consistent invariant across transformations of representation that allow an observer to label a system or structure as “the same.” Identity is not an intrinsic property, but an emergent fixed point of pattern recognition across context. It is the stabilization of a pattern—what persists and is preserved amidst entropy and change.

**Prose:**
Identity arises when a pattern crosses the threshold of persistence and recognizability. It is what allows us to say, across time and transformation, that this is still that. Identity is not atomic or absolute; it is always defined relative to an observer and an equivalence relation. In the dance of meaning, identity is the anchor, the stabilizing force that gives patterns their enduring reference. All selves, categories, and concepts exist by virtue of being reflexively pattern-stabilized identities.
