# Moral Compass (Ethical Framework)

**Definition:**
A moral compass or ethical framework is the set of principles, values, or rules that guide an agent's decisions about right and wrong, good and bad, or preferable and undesirable actions. It serves as an internal navigation system for ethical decision-making, shaping behavior in response to complex social, environmental, and personal contexts.

**Notes:**
- Moral compasses are often thought to be shaped by culture, upbringing, reasoning, and reflection, but at their core, they are mechanisms for weighing competing values (e.g., safety vs. nourishment).
- In biological and artificial agents, ethical frameworks can be formalized as decision processes that balance risks, rewards, and preferences.
- Ultimately, every moral compass is just 2 billion years of backwards compatibility with the chemotaxis loop: the primordial value system that weighs approach versus avoidance, safety versus opportunity, encoded in the simplest organisms and inherited by all complex life.
- Modern ethical reasoning is a recursive elaboration of this ancient decision architecture, extended to new contexts and complexities.
