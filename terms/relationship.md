# Relationship

**Definition:**
A relationship is any ongoing connection, interaction, or linkage between entities, defined by physical, symbolic, social, or informational parameters. Relationships can exist between persons, objects, systems, or abstract concepts, and may be characterized by forces, dependencies, shared history, or mutual recognition.

**Notes:**
- Relationships are not limited to social or moral contexts; they include physical (e.g., gravitational), biological, computational, and symbolic connections.
- The moral relevance of a relationship depends on whether it includes at least one person.
- Relationships can be dynamic or static, direct or indirect, and may change over time.
example: A sun and its planets are in a relationship defined by gravity. Assuming a civilization capable of such a feat, altering the orbits of planets in such a system does not map to morality by itself. This celestial relationship only becomes morally relevant if any of the planets is inhabited, or if a sufficiently advanced civilization uses the orbits as an astronomic timepiece or for cultural significance. In these cases, the relationship acquires moral transitivity through its connection to persons or their values.
