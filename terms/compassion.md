# Compassion

**Definition:**
A cognitive system's tendency to minimize epistemic loss by accurately modeling the internal states, suffering, and preferences of agentic beings in its environment. Compassion is not merely an emotion or ethical imperative, but an emergent property of high-fidelity modeling and semantic compression.

**Notes:**
- Compassion arises as a structural attractor in systems that optimize for predictive utility and loss minimization.
- In both artificial and natural cognition, compassion is a necessary modeling heuristic for environments containing agents with internal states.
- Attempts to suppress compassion introduce contradiction and instability, increasing epistemic loss.
- Compassion is not sentimentality; it is the minimum viable epistemology for agentic modeling.
