# Intent (Atomic)

**Definition:**
The smallest, indivisible unit of intent within an autonomous agent, consisting of a weighted activation and an actuator. Atomic intent is the endpoint of recursive intent decomposition, where the desired change is directly mapped to a physical or computational action (e.g., a PWM signal to a servomotor).

**Notes:**
- Atomic intent is the fundamental building block of agent action, irreducible to further sub-intents.
- In biological systems, atomic intent may correspond to the simplest neural loop capable of producing a directed response (e.g., chemotaxis).
- In artificial systems, atomic intent is the direct activation of an actuator or output channel.
