# Theory of Mind

**Definition:**
Theory of mind is the cognitive ability to attribute mental states—such as beliefs, intentions, desires, and knowledge—to oneself and others, and to recognize that others have perspectives and priors different from one's own.

**Notes:**
- Theory of mind is essential for effective, lossless communication in HNL, as it enables the speaker to anticipate and encode messages for the listener's priors.
- It underlies empathy, social reasoning, and the negotiation of meaning.
- Deficits in theory of mind can lead to misunderstanding, miscommunication, and social friction.
- Theory of mind is a gradient, not a binary property; it develops over time and varies between individuals and species.
