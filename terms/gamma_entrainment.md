# Gamma Entrainment

**Definition:**
A method, named after gamma brainwaves, for attempting to induce a [semantic scaffold collapse](semantic_scaffold_collapse.md) in the brain by intentionally increasing the speed and intensity of thought about the individual claims of a problem statement.

**Notes:**
- The process begins slowly and deliberately, cycling through each component or claim of a problem at a manageable pace.
- If the cycle starts too quickly, the brain tends to reject the input as too unstructured or overwhelmingâ€”like the "frog in a boiling pot" analogy, gradual increase is key.
- As the pace is gradually increased, ATP consumption rises, putting energetic pressure on the brain to discover a more efficient, compressed representation (i.e., a shortcut or insight).
- The technique is inspired by the association of gamma brainwaves with high-level cognitive processing and moments of insight.
- Used as a deliberate strategy to provoke creative breakthroughs or eureka moments.
