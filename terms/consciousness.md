# Consciousness

**Definition:**
Consciousness is the state or process by which a system becomes aware of itself and its own operations, in addition to modeling the external world. It is the capacity for self-reflection, subjective experience, and the ability to direct attention inward as well as outward.

- The unconscious brain already models the world: it predicts predators, prey behavior, and how the environment responds to its actions.
- This modeling process continually reduces loss (prediction error), but there remains a residual lossâ€”an inaccuracy that cannot be explained by modeling the external world alone.
- At this point, the model turns its attention to the one thing it has not yet modeled: itself. This self-modeling is the emergence of consciousness.
- Consciousness is thus an adaptive response to irreducible prediction error, enabling a system to include itself as an object of modeling and prediction.

**Prose:**
Consciousness arises not as a magical spark, but as a pragmatic solution to a persistent problem: the world is never fully predictable, and some errors in prediction cannot be explained by external causes. The unconscious mind is already a powerful modeler, anticipating threats, opportunities, and the consequences of action. But when the unexplained loss persists, the only remaining hypothesis is that the source of error lies within. The system turns its modeling power inward, constructing a model of itself as an agent in the world. This recursive, self-referential modeling is the root of conscious experience. Consciousness, then, is not a binary property but a gradient, deepening as the self-model becomes more sophisticated and integrated with the world-model.
