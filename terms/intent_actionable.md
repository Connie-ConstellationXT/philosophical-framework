# Intent (Actionable)

**Definition:**
A desired change in itself or the environment of an autonomous agent, which the agent can cause by decomposing the intent into smaller, modular sub-intents. Actionable intent is the high-level goal or directive that guides agent behavior, and is subject to recursive breakdown until atomic intent is reached.

**Notes:**
- Actionable intent is not necessarily atomic; it may consist of multiple layers of sub-intents, each representing a step or module in the overall change process.
- The process of decomposing intent continues until the smallest actionable unit (atomic intent) is identified.
- In artificial and biological systems, actionable intent drives planning, decision-making, and execution.
