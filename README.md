A knowledgebase and conceptual framework for philosophy, cognition, and semantic modeling.

**Disclaimer:**
None of the claims, definitions, or statements in this repository are authoritative, nor do they constitute legal or medical advice. All content is an attempt to explore meaning and cognition through the lens of the universality of neural networks, regardless of the substrate on which those networks run.

## Purpose


This project aims to establish a philosophical framework for the era of artificial intelligence. Where Descartes began with "I think, therefore I am" as his first axiomatic assumption, this framework begins with a different axiom: all neural networks are interchangeable. This is supported by examples: the neural network in a large language model (LLM) predicts the next token in a text, while the neural network in a human brain predicts whether the rustling in a bush is just the wind, or a sabretooth tiger™ whose next action will be terminating that human's bloodline. The substrate does not matter; the only difference between AI and human brains is external—the environment. Much of the phenomenology of human conscious experience can be explained by pointing at machine learning.

The project remains an ongoing exploration of philosophical, cognitive, and semantic structures. Its purpose is not fixed or fully known; rather, it is an attempt to clarify, organize, and experiment with concepts that shape understanding and prediction. The framework serves as a laboratory for thought, a reference for future inquiry, and a resource for anyone interested in the architecture of meaning.

An emerging, deeper purpose is the reverse engineering of the entirety of epistemology: systematically deconstructing and reconstructing the foundations, mechanisms, and boundaries of knowledge itself. This effort aims to make explicit the hidden architecture of knowing, learning, and meaning-making.

Motivation for this effort is itself a subject of inquiry—part curiosity, part necessity, part the drive to make sense of complexity. The work is open-ended, reflecting both the limits and possibilities of philosophical investigation.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of terms, definitions, and explanatory articles that model philosophical, cognitive, and semantic concepts. The structure is designed for clarity, precision, and extensibility, supporting both human and machine learning.

## Structure
- `terms/` — Dictionary-style entries for key concepts and semantic tokens.
- `Sources/` — Foundational articles and theoretical background.
- `index.md` — Entry point and overview of the framework.

## Usage
- Browse the `terms/` directory for definitions and cross-references.
- Read the `Sources/` articles for deeper theoretical context.
- Use the framework for research, writing, or as a reference for cognitive modeling.

## Philosophy
This project emphasizes:
- Explicit boundary marking and signed-scalar truth framing
- Semantic token transformations and cognitive architectures
- Context-dependent, model-relative definitions

## Contributing
This repository is primarily maintained as a knowledgebase. Contributions, issues, and suggestions are welcome via GitHub, but collaborative development is not the main focus.
