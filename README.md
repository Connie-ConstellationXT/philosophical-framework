# philosophical-framework

A knowledgebase and conceptual framework for philosophy, cognition, and semantic modeling.

## Purpose

This project exists as an ongoing exploration of philosophical, cognitive, and semantic structures. Its purpose is not fixed or fully known; rather, it is an attempt to clarify, organize, and experiment with concepts that shape understanding and prediction. The framework serves as a laboratory for thought, a reference for future inquiry, and a resource for anyone interested in the architecture of meaning.

Motivation for this effort is itself a subject of inquiry—part curiosity, part necessity, part the drive to make sense of complexity. The work is open-ended, reflecting both the limits and possibilities of philosophical investigation.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of terms, definitions, and explanatory articles that model philosophical, cognitive, and semantic concepts. The structure is designed for clarity, precision, and extensibility, supporting both human and machine learning.

## Structure
- `terms/` — Dictionary-style entries for key concepts and semantic tokens.
- `Sources/` — Foundational articles and theoretical background.
- `index.md` — Entry point and overview of the framework.

## Usage
- Browse the `terms/` directory for definitions and cross-references.
- Read the `Sources/` articles for deeper theoretical context.
- Use the framework for research, writing, or as a reference for cognitive modeling.

## Philosophy
This project emphasizes:
- Explicit boundary marking and signed-scalar truth framing
- Semantic token transformations and cognitive architectures
- Context-dependent, model-relative definitions

## Contributing
This repository is primarily maintained as a personal knowledgebase. Contributions, issues, and suggestions are welcome via GitHub, but collaborative development is not the main focus.
